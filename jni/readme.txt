JNI examples:
1. j2c/:  java calls C/C++ code using swig
2  dj2c/: director usage: C++ defines interface, and java provides implementation
3. c2j/:  c++ call java; using swig to reduce the work passing from c++ to java
4. c2j2c: c++ call java; while java calls back some c++ code
        - japp: pure java code
        - capp: pure c++ code
        - papp: proxy classes; and code generated by swig
